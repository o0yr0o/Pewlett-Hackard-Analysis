# Pewlett Hackard Analysis with SQL

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to help Bobby’s manager preparing for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age. In order to do so, we need to determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Results
### Number of Retiring Employees Per Title
All retiring employees were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955.

- The number of eligible mentors is way less than the number of retiring employees. The company should focus on acquire more experienced employees.
- Bobby's manager need to be prepared to recruit more senior engineers since they have the most number of retiring employees and fewer eligible mentors.
- Engineer has higher number of eligible mentors, company can upskill them to make them become senior engineers.
- The company can hire younger employees and invite them to the mentorship program which can accelerate their learning and development. A mentorship program is a great way to invest in younger employees, and also mentorship program can increase the retention rate.

- From the table above by comparing retiring employees and eligible mentors, we can see that there are not enough qualified, retirement-ready employees to mentor the next generation.
